# Advanced_PD-Tool-OpenLANE-SKY130
This repository contains all the contents studied and created during the Advanced Physical Design Workshop using OpenLANE and SKY130 PDK

OpenLane is representation of a RTL to GDSII flow which uses many opensource EDA tools like OpenRoad, Yosys, ABC, Fault, Qflow, Magic and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. And SKY130 is PDK used here.
